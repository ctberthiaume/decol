- does this work on windows (different newlines, different file open behavior
  for binary/text)?
- does this work with Python 2 and 3 for both Linux/MacOS and Windows,
  related to above?
- csv.Reader says the file should be opened with newline='' for Python 3,
  presumably because the module handles newlines itself. We're using click.File
  to handle file opening. Does it do the right thing on both Linux/MacOS and
  Windows?
